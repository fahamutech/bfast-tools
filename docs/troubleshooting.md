# Troubleshooting

## "not in project folder or bfast.json is missing"

Cause:
- You are not in a workspace generated by `bfast fs create`.

Fix:
- `cd` into a valid workspace.
- Ensure `bfast.json` exists.

## "functions folder not found in current project"

Cause:
- Workspace is incomplete or modified.

Fix:
- Ensure `<workspace>/functions` exists.
- Recreate workspace with `bfast fs create <name>` if needed.

## "bfast.json is invalid JSON"

Cause:
- Invalid JSON syntax in `bfast.json`.

Fix:
- Correct JSON formatting.
- Compare with template created by `bfast fs create`.

## Serve starts but routes are missing

Checks:
- Verify functions are exported correctly from files in `functions/`.
- Check `ignore` patterns in `bfast.json`.
- Run static mode to isolate watcher issues:

```bash
bfast fs serve --static --port 3000
```
